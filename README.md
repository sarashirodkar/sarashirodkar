### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm **Sara**, a software engineer from New York, US.

I'm primarily interested in the full-stack development. My tech stack includes Python, Java, Go, Django, Flask, Spring Boot, and SQL.

I specialize in building scalable systems and data-driven applications. My experience spans developing metrics management tools, predictive models for YouTube content analysis, and automating high-traffic customer-facing systems. Passionate about creating large-scale, impactful products, I have contributed to major feature launches and industry-leading services, enhancing global user experiences. Let's build something innovative together!

Outside of work, Iâ€™m passionate about exploring advancements in science and technology. I also play a lot of video games and my current mission is to, at least be presentable at Valorant(still a Sage, but working on becoming a Raze main).
