### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I'm [**Sara**], a software engineer from New York, US.

I'm primarily interested in **full-stack development**: Python, Java, Go, Django, Flask, Spring Boot

I'm fascinated by large-scale, high-impact products and have worked on industry-leading services as well as apps that have a global user base. I have contributed to major feature launches and automating systems in customer-facing consoles with high traffic.

Outside of work, I'm interested in following the developments of science. I also play a lot of video games and my current mission is to be at least presentable at Valorant!
